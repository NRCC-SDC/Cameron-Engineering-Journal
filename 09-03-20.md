- Today, I tested out my query speeds and implemented indexing to speed them up. 
- The query times for the '/products/:productId' route (with 10M records in database):
    Before indexing: 28.395 sec
    After indexing: 4.165 sec
- Both before and after indexing, the '/products/:productId/styles' route is timing out before it sends anything back

Tomorrow, I am going to try testing the routes with only 1M records in the database.  That way I can at least establish a baseline speed for the styles route and make sure it is set up correctly.

I am then going to try to continue to speed up the routes.  I also want to try to speed up the seeding of my database tomorrow.
