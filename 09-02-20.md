- Today, I realized that there should be a way to insert my JSON documents into mongo without having to read their contents.  The Javascript heap was overflowing because I was using readFile to read the contents before inserting them.  This makes it so that there isn't even really a benefit in generating the data separately from inserting it
- I decided to look into how to insert documents into a mongo database using the command line. I thought this would be a way to definitely make sure Javascript was not reading the file
- Then, I figured out there is a way to do command line scripts in Javascript.  I thought this might make it easier to not have to type in a bash command each time I want to seed the database and would also make it easier to test the amount of time it takes
- I was able to successfully load one file into Mongo, but wasn't sure how to go about adding multiple files.  After looking for a while on how to do this in the command line, I realized that I could create a loop in Javascript and create a new command line script for each file name.
- I was able to load all 10 Million files!  However, it took around 45 minutes, so I still need to find ways to make it faster

Tomorrow, my goal is to test out query speeds and start optimizing those.  After that, I am going to try to speed up the time it takes to seed my database as well.
