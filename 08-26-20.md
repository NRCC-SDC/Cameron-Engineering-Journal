- Set up Express routes for the same endpoints as the Greenfield API
- Refactored Axios requests to make calls to the server instead of the API
- Looked into which database might be more performant

SQL
- easier to update in multiple places
- can't scale horizontally and vertical scaling has a limit
- limitations when doing thousands of read and write queries per second
- Good for complex data structures/data that is highly related

NoSQL
- built to store lots of data
- flexible regarding data structure
- strong choice if you have a lot of reads and not a lot of writes
- data can be split horizontally (horizontal scaling)
- No relationships between data
- Data is typically merged/nested in a few collections
- Great performance for mass (simple) read and write requests
- Good for more simple queries

Right now, I am leaning towards MongoDB for the Product Overview section because:
1. I only need to make get requests, so I do not need to update the database in multiple locations
2. My data does not need complex queries or relationships to other data
3. MongoDB has great performance for mass read and write requests, so it seems like it would perform well for the type and amount of data I will be using

I am going to be looking at this a little more tomorrow before making a final decision
